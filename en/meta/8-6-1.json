According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. </p><p>Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. </p><p>Employment is defined as all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.  </p><p>For the purpose of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. </p><p>Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle managers.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Computed from 2010 population census and 2015 LFS</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-11-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-11-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Insitetalk/data/commit/1ebf378fd44be164140d1417f1b456a43a94c9ac","indicator":"8.6.1","target_id":"8.6","sdg_goal":"8","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"08-06-01","indicator_name":"Proportion of youth (aged 15\u201324\u00a0years) not in education, employment or training","graph_title":"Proportion of youth (aged 15\u201324\u00a0years) not in education, employment or training"}
