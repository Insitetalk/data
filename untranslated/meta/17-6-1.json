High-speed Internet access is important to ensure that Internet users have quality access to the Internet and can take advantage of the growing amount of Internet content \u2013 including user-generated content \u2013, services and information.</p><p>While the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions has increased substantially over the last years and while service providers offer increasingly higher speeds, fixed Internet broadband can vary tremendously by speed, thus affecting the quality and functionality of Internet access. Many countries, especially in the developing world, have not only a very limited amount of fixed-broadband subscriptions, but also at very low speeds. This limitation is a barrier to the Target 17.6 and the indicator highlights the potential of the Internet (especially through high-speed access) to enhance cooperation, improve access to science, technology and innovation, and share knowledge. The indicator also highlights the importance of Internet use as a development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains. Information on fixed broadband subscriptions by speed will contribute to the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-29","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Insitetalk/data/commit/752271c33267ba1ff42a38bbec40d97e99ffba8e","indicator":"17.6.1","target_id":"17.6","sdg_goal":"17","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"17-06-01","indicator_name":"Households access to fixed internet service","graph_title":"Households access to fixed internet service"}
